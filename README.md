# ✈️ Flight Price Detection App

### **Short Description**

A Streamlit-based machine learning web app that predicts flight ticket prices using multiple regression models including Linear, Lasso, Ridge, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. Built for travelers and analysts to explore how airline, route, and timing factors affect flight costs.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Flight Price Detection App** leverages machine learning to estimate airfare prices based on flight-related features such as airline, departure time, total stops, and duration. Using Streamlit, the app provides an interactive interface for real-time predictions and comparison of model performance.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling features.
2. **Model Training** – Evaluated multiple regression models for price prediction.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning** – Applied RandomizedSearchCV for optimized performance.
4. **Evaluation Metrics** – Models were compared using R² score, MSE, and RMSE.
5. **Deployment** – The best-performing model integrated into a Streamlit web app.
